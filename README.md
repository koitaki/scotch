Quick Tip

While not necessary, this is a convenience. To get your browser to automatically refresh every time you save your index.html file, we will use a package called BrowserSync and lite-server.

To install and use:

Install Node and npm
Make sure you can see your Node version using node -v and npm -v from your command line.
Install lite-server: npm install -g lite-server
From inside your project folder, run lite-server.
Your browser should then open to http://localhost:3000 and open your index.html file. This will also be refreshed whenever you save your files!
